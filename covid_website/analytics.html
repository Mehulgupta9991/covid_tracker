                <h2>Data Acquisition</h2>
                <p>COVID-19 time series data for US counties was obtained from the Johns Hopkins University. This data provided case counts on each day from February 25 - April 25. This data can be found <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>

                <p>Regional features for the US relevant to health were obtained from US County Health Rankings, curated by Alberta Innovates. This data provided features of US counties, as indexed by their FIPS. This data can be found at <a href="https://app.dataxch.ai/#/dataset/86beffad-69ad-4079-9383-56c4bf8fe4c7" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>

                <p>Regional features for the US relevant to demographics and economy were obtained from the Social Vulnerability Index 2016, curated by Alberta Innovates. This data provided features of US counties, as indexed by their FIPS. This data can be found <a href="https://app.dataxch.ai/#/dataset/9426ed66-36a4-496f-a803-62162e649c55" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>

                <p>All regional features of US counties were used in original analyses, but specific features were selected for further analysis following preliminar regression modelling with COVID-19 case counts. The selected features are presented in data analysis, and further described.</p><br>

                <p>All regional features of Canadian provinces were obtained from Statistics Canada. This data can be found <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects-start/population_and_demography" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                
                <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
                <p>COVID-19 case counts per 100,000 and demographic data were combined by county based upon FIPS number, a unique identifier for each county. The number of cases per 100,000 at predefined time points (5-30 days from the date of the first confirmed case in 5-day increments), were used in regression analysis. For each of the aforementioned days, demographic values including income, percent seniors, percent poverty, median income, and population density were regressed against the number of cases. This regression was repeated for each case count of interest (6 in total), providing a unique linear regression model for each value. The result of these regression analyses are an intercept value and unique coefficient values for each of the predictive variables, which can be utilized with provided values to estimate number of COVID-19 related cases at each of the selected time points (6 in total). This regression analysis was repeated for number of COVID-19 related deaths, and a 15-day lag time was adjusted for in the analysis. Therefore, given values for income, percent seniors, percent poverty, median income, and population density, for a particular area, the tool will be able to predict the number of cases and deaths at each of the provided time points. The provided variable values are used to estimate the number of cases at each time point, utilizing the regression equations trained for each of the timepoints. Following this, the number of cases are also estimated at defined time points using the regression equations trained on corresponding data. These values are plotted to generate a curve indicative of the case count and death count versus days from first confirmed infection. This analysis is unique from others, due to its lack of reliance on conceptual frameworks. By training regression models on observed COVID-19 related data (case and death counts), this tool is able to make predictions agnostic to predicative models that may not be optimised or relevant to COVID-19.</p>

                <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
                <p>In order to make the given analysis interactive, an R Shiny Application was developed to allow for users to experiment with how different combinations of area demographics may affect the rate of COVID-19 spread (dygraphs was used to create the plot the interactive graph). In the application, users are able to use sliders located in the toolbar region of the application to change the particular demographic characteristics of an area. The values for different Canadian provinces are provided in the “Reference Stats” tab. As the user changes the demographics of the area that they are interested in, a graph plotting days from first case versus number of cases is generated. This graph will update in real time, to facilitate understanding of how different demographic variables influence the spread of COVID-19.</p>
