                <h2>Data Acquisition</h2>
                <p>COVID-19 time series data for US counties was obtained from the Johns Hopkins University. This data provided case counts on each day from February 25 - April 25. This data can be found <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>

                <p>Regional features for the US relevant to health were obtained from US County Health Rankings, curated by Alberta Innovates. This data provided features of US counties, as indexed by their FIPS. This data can be found <a href="https://app.dataxch.ai/#/dataset/86beffad-69ad-4079-9383-56c4bf8fe4c7" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>

                <p>Regional features for the US relevant to demographics and economy were obtained from the Social Vulnerability Index 2016, curated by Alberta Innovates. This data provided features of US counties, as indexed by their FIPS. This data can be found <a href="https://app.dataxch.ai/#/dataset/9426ed66-36a4-496f-a803-62162e649c55" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>

                <p>All regional features of US counties were used in original analyses, but specific features were selected for further analysis following preliminar regression modelling with COVID-19 case counts. The selected features are presented in data analysis, and further described.</p><br>

                <p>All regional features of Canadian provinces were obtained from Statistics Canada. This data can be found <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects-start/population_and_demography" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                
                <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
                <p>COVID-19 datasets (i.e case counts per 100,000 and demographic data) were combined by county based upon FIPS number, a unique identifier for each county. The time (in days) from the first case required to achieve particular case thresholds (15-120 in 15 case increments) was determined for each county. Additionally, corresponding censor values (indicating a county did not achieve the defined case number) was assigned for each case threshold. Following this, the dataset was partitioned equally into training and validation datasets for discovery and implementation of the predictive models. In the training set, the aforementioned day values were treated as time-to-event variables with their corresponding censoring value in a multivariate cox proportional hazards regression. Predictive values regressed against day values include income, percent seniors, percent poverty, percent uninsured, median income, and population density. This regression was repeated for each case count of interest (8 in total), providing a unique cox model for each value. These cox models were used to predict a risk score for each county in the validation cohort based upon the aforementioned demographic variables and the beta-coefficients defined in the training cohort. Following this, the computed risk scores were used in a linear regression model against the days to variable in the validation cohort. The result of this is a coefficient and intercept value, which when utilized with a given risk score value, predicts the number of days required to reach a particular case number. As before, 8 unique regression equations were obtained, as 8 case count thresholds (15-120 in 15 case increments) were of interest in this study. Therefore, given values for income, percent seniors, percent poverty, percent uninsured, median income, and population density, for a particular area, the tool will be able to predict the number of days required to reach each of the defined case counts. First the given area is assigned a risk score for each of the 8 case count thresholds using the unique cox model developed and the provided demographics. Following this, each risk score is used in each of the 8 linear regression equations respectively, to provide an estimate of the number of days required to reach that case count threshold. These values are plotted to generate a curve indicative of the case count and days required to hit this given case count. Additionally, we plot the number of cases expected to require hospitalization based on population level estimates of the hospitalization rate.</p>

                <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
                <p>In order to make the given analysis interactive, an R Shiny Application was developed to allow for users to experiment with how different combinations of area demographics may affect the rate of COVID-19 spread. In the application, users are able to use sliders located on the left side of the application to change the particular demographic characteristics of an area. The values for different Canadian provinces are provided as well in the “Reference Stats” tab. As the user changes the demographics of the area that they are interested in, a graph plotting days from first case versus number of cases is generated. This graph will change in real time, to facilitate understanding of how different demographic variables influence the spread of COVID-19.</p>
